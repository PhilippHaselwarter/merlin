(** The outline parser proceeds by side-effects:
  * - most productions have no attached semantic action
  * - when the parser finds a syntactic construct that it knows how to chunk
  *   (above: module or definition), it raises the [Chunk] exception.
  * The associated position is the position of the last token of the
  * chunk, so that, if the parser consumed a lookahead token, it can
  * be recognized and added back to the lexing buffer.
  * EX: let a = 5 type t = ...
  *                  ^ |CHUNK: let a = 5|
  *   The parser raises [Chunk] only after [type], so we must add the
  *   [type] token back to the input stream.

(** Used to ignore first-class modules.
  * The construct "let module = … in " allows to define a module
  * locally inside a definition, but our outline parser cannot work
  * inside a definition (it is either correct as a whole,
  * or incorrect).
  * After call to [enter_sub], such constructions are not reported
  * until a call to its dual [leave_sub] is made.
