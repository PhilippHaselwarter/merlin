(** Used to ignore first-class modules.
  * The construct "let module = â€¦ in " allows to define a module
  * locally inside a definition, but our outline parser cannot work
  * inside a definition (it is either correct as a whole,
  * or incorrect).
  * [nesting] is incremented at the beginning of such constructions
  * (here, [let module]) and decremented at its end (here, after the
  * module expression is parsed).No module definition is reported
  * while [!nesting > 0].
